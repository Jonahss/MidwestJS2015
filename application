Appium is an Open Source project which drives the automation of user interactions on iOS and Android devices, for the purpose of fully testing your app or mobile website. Perform touch gestures, inspect the screen, type into textfields, Appium can perform these actions and more when controlled by a test script. Test scripts can be written in any language as Appium conforms to the same protocol that Selenium (the leading browser automation tool) uses to automate browsers.

Join me for a full walkthrough of how Appium works, how to set it up, and test best-practices with in-depth code examples. Additionally, I will demonstrate how to run Appium in a cloud environment running tests in parallel across multiple platforms.
